<h1>About Shiny DraCor</h1>

<p>We maintain two in-house corpora, a <b>Russian Drama Corpus (RusDraCor)</b> and a <b>German Drama Corpus (GerDraCor)</b>, both comprising plays from the 1730s to the 1930s. Both corpora are encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative">TEI</a>, an XML vocabulary, which makes it easy to extract structural information.</p>

<p>RusDraCor comprises <i>76 plays</i>, GerDraCor hold <i>465 plays</i> at present (early December, 2017), but we will be growing both text collections throughout the next year. Featured authors of RusDraCor so far are Blok, Bulgakov, Chechov, Fonvizin, Gogol, Gorkij, Gumilyov, Krylov, Lermontov, Majakovskij, Ostrovskij, Plavilschikov, Prutkov 😉, Pushkin, Sumarokov, Leo and Aleksey Tolstoy and Turgenev. German authors are too many to be listed here.</p>

<p>Our main purpose is the social network analysis of these dramatic texts: we extract social situations by collecting information on who is talking along with others in a given segment of a play (acts, scenes, other constellations). Via an API, we offer structural information, which we can analyse with a variety of tools. This website gives you the opportunity to explore the social structure of individual plays.</p>

<p>The analytical part for this page was done by Ivan Pozdniakov in R and is presented by help of the web application framework <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>, hosted on our own server. Ultimately, we are interested in structural changes over time, the evolution of Russian and German drama, so to speak, for which we provide other tools.</p>
