<h1>About Shiny DraCor</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This web app provides simple means to analyse co-occurrence networks of plays. It builds on the <a href = "https://dracor.org/doc/api">DraCor API</a> and enables access to network data from more than 3,000 plays in more than a dozen corpora. For an overview see the <a href="https://dracor.org/">DraCor frontpage</a>. All corpora are encoded in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative">TEI</a>, an XML-based markup language that makes it easy to extract structural information.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>The app was built by Ivan Pozdniakov in R and is presented using the web application framework <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>.</p>
