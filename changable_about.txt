<h1>About RusDraCor</h1>
<p>Our project <b>Russian Drama Corpus (RusDraCor)</b> aims at presenting a
collection of Russian plays from the 1740s to the 1930s. The entire
corpus is encoded in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative">TEI</a>, an XML vocabulary, which makes it easy to
extract structural information.</p>  

<p>RusDraCor comprises <i>67 plays</i> at present (early July, 2017), but will
be growing throughout the year. Featured authors so far are Blok,
Bulgakov, Chechov, Fonvizin, Gogol, Gorkij, Gumilyov, Krylov,
Majakovskij, Ostrovskij, Plavilschikov, Prutkov O, Pushkin, Sumarokov, Leo Tolstoy
and Turgenev.</p>  

<p>Our main purpose is the social network analysis of these dramatic texts:
we extract social situations by collecting information on who is talking
along with others in a given segment of a play (acts, scenes, other
constellations). Our extraction scripts generate CSV files, which we can
analyse with a variety of tools. This website gives you the opportunity
to explore the social structure of individual plays.</p>

<p>The analytical part for this page was done by Ivan Pozdniakov in R and
is presented by help of the web application framework Shiny. Ultimately,
we are interested in structural changes over time, the evolution of
Russian drama, so to speak, for which we will provide other tools.</p>
